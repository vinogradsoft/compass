# Reporting security issues

We value the contributions of the security research community.

## Where should I report security issues?

It is strongly recommended that you report all security issues privately via our email <b style="color:#4184e4;">
sec@vinogradsoft.com</b> rather than via GitHub. Please provide relevant technical details and reproduction steps to
expedite the investigation.
