Thank you for contributing to this project.

Please submit pull requests to the master branch only.

Please run phpunit.

If you have added something new, create a new unit test. If you have changed something, update all unit tests as necessary.

We aim to achieve 100% code coverage by tests, including checking for PHP errors and exceptional situations. Therefore, make sure your new or modified tests fully cover all changes you have made.
